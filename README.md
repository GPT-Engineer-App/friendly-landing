# friendly-landing

Create a Saas landing page with a header and footer. Use a vibrant color and modern, clean and friendly layout. Use emojis as accents in text, but be careful to not go overboard. The header should have title and menu items "about, "tools", pricing" on the left and menu items login, signup and dark mode on the right. In light mode, the header and teaser section should both have the same vibrant color as the background. Add simple routing and subpages linked to the menu items. For the teaser section, we want a compelling title, subtitle and social proof. For the sign up page, we want users to register via email, etsy and google (you can mock the functionality). Create a simple login form for the login page. Generate some sample content and copy for the landing page. Tone should be friendly, casual and positive (like a good friend).
